# Options-Pricing
Stochastic Simulations in Option Pricing: This repository hosts my side project, which builds upon the theory taught in STAT 340 - Stochastic Simulation Methods. It features implementations of Monte Carlo methods and Variance Reduction Techniques for pricing financial options, demonstrating practical applications of the concepts learned.
